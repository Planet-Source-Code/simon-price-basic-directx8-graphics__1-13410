## Basic DirectX8 graphics


</div>

### Description

I've had DirectX 8 installed for only a few hours so I've just made my first program to test it out. This would be useful for beginners. It spins around a pyrimid shape which glows different colors. Very simple and commented on almost every line. Probably requires some sort of hardware acceleration. After hours and hours of downloading 150MB through my 56KB/sec phone line, DX8 seems worth the wait. You'll be suprised at how easy it is to program! Although where is the support for 2D? I'd be interested in any 2D DX8 progs. Please comment if this is useful to you, or if you have any problems with it.
